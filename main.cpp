 *
 *      Implementation of the cellular automata model from paper: "Habitat loss and the disassembly of mutalistic networks"
 *
 *      To Do: REFACTOR TO CREATE A SIMULATION CLASS! (THEN CAN FARM OUT SIMULATIONS USING OPENMP?)
 *
 *      For the grid (landscape), the index x refers to column i.e. x~[0,width]
 *                                          y refers to row    i.e. y~[0,height]
 *
 *      In the adjacency representation plants are columns (indexed by i) and animals are rows (indexed by j).
 *      This is in keeping with the notation used in the paper, and the network representations found in the literature.
